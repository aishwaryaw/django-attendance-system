# django-attendance-system

Built a simple employee attendance system with Django framework and PostgreSQL database system where each employee's today's attendance can be filled in one go if not already done, if already filled then can be viewed, previous attendance details can be viewed with date range filtering functionality.
Employee details can be added, updated and deleted with the help of validation forms.
Employees data can be filtered with the help of email searching functionality and departments selection.
